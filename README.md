# Pico W Fire Alert System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fire detection and alert system using a Raspberry Pi Pico W. It detects nearby fires, displays the status on a 16x2 LCD screen, and sends mobile notifications using the Pushbullet API. The entire system is implemented in MicroPython and developed using the Thonny IDE.

## Features
- Real-time fire detection
- Status display on 16x2 LCD
- Mobile notifications via Pushbullet
- Developed and deployed using Thonny IDE

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Fire/Flame sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Software Requirements
- MicroPython
- Thonny IDE
- Pushbullet account and API key

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the hardware components (refer to video demo)
2. Install Thonny IDE on your computer
3. Open the project files in Thonny
4. Ensure MicroPython is installed on your Raspberry Pi Pico W
5. Use Thonny to upload the project files to your Pico W

## Usage
Once set up, the system will continuously monitor for fire. The LCD will display the current status, and you'll receive a Pushbullet notification if a fire is detected.
